- Whenever using BEFORE or AFTER in css, make sure you use CONTENT: '';


top: 50%;
transform: translateY(-50%); 
/* Moves the arrows to the exact middle by using TOP and TRANSFORM*/

THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH ARROW FUNCTIONS, we need to use a regular function
this.appendChild(x)

const length = +lengthEl.value // Adding a plus in front parses this as a number

('contextmenu', () => {}) THIS IS A RIGHT CLICK IN JS
